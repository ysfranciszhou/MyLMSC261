##Network assignment

For this assignment, I chose "Modular LED Controller Workstation", contributed by Segfault16, fruechtegott,
openhousespec & Chason Deshotel: https://github.com/segfault16/modular-led-controller-workstation

Three things that I found interesting were:
  · Driving Large Amounts of LED's: https://github.com/segfault16/modular-led-controller-workstation/issues/100
  · Automatic switch of active project slot via audio: https://github.com/segfault16/modular-led-controller-workstation/issues/85
  · Beat Detection: https://github.com/segfault16/modular-led-controller-workstation/issues/57

The workflow that I noticed in the discussions & comments is:
  · One contributor come up an idea ➡️ Others commented below with some solutions or hints
  · One contributor update the bugs or issues ➡️ Others helps to find where the issues are

Mostly contributors would include references in their posts, sometimes with subtitles for the process of their ideas. They also might include some codes in the discussions.

I think the platform gives programmers a great space to communicate & learning. Programmers collab with each others, coming up ideas. Users post their thoughts or issues that they met to help the programmers enhance their projects. The communications between Github users are logical and convincible. The sources helps programmers to understand and writing codes, given them ideas and hints.
