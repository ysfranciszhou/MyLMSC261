The first issue we met was the branches. We couldn't clone the branch so took some time to figure out what's the problem. After we invite the members, it works.

So we started to edit our bio. It actually took us a long time to make things work because what we edited doesn't shows on main branch, or the info we edited caused conflict to main branch. What we did is we find out the conflicts, deleted the duplicated contents and merged our branches to main branch. This issue probably took us the longest time.

The last thing we do was the images, we uploaded the images. It works fine until we tried to upload more than one images. The computer can't read the instruction cause it was basically at the same position, So we decided just to use one image.

I was the host so at first I shared the screen to fix the issue with JJ and Justin. For website We basically contributed the same: edited our own bio, uploaded the images and so on. Justin actually helped us a lot on the branches. JJ also contributed a lot on the conflict issues, so does Justin.
