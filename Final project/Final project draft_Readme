##Final project proposal
For final project, I want to make a game that is similar to "Don't stop eighth note".
The difference is the character will continue walking rather than using voice to make it walks.
I plan to add "kill" motion to the game by using a short voice like a clap.
For jumping, players are going to use long sustain notes to keep the character flying.
